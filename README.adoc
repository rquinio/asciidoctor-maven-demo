A small example that demonstrates how http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] can be used in Maven to generate multiple backends from shared sources:

* A multi-page *https://rquinio.github.io/asciidoctor-maven-demo/index.html[Maven site]* with a navigation sidebar, using [asciidoctor-maven-plugin] Doxia asciidoc sink.
* A single-page *https://rquinio.github.io/asciidoctor-maven-demo/handbook/handbook.html[HTML handbook]*, using [asciidoctor-maven-plugin]
* A *https://rquinio.github.io/asciidoctor-maven-demo/handbook/handbook.pdf[PDF handbook]*, using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[asciidoctor-pdf]
* A *https://rquinio.github.io/asciidoctor-maven-demo/slides/slides.html[reveal.js presentation]*, using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js[asciidoctor-reveal.js]

This is inspired by https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-examples[asciidoctor-maven-examples], but rather than having multiple sub-modules, it generates multiple outputs inside a single project, re-using the same base material.

Interesting bits:

* Fallbacking from fonts to images for admonition on the Maven site
* Using leveloffset with includes, to integrate individual fragments
* Using ifdef::backend-* when content is only needed for a specific backend
* Including source code and linking to a generated Javadoc
* Including images from sub-templates and relative paths (buggy)

To build the project:
